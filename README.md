# To-Do-List-App
<br>
It is my 3rd project by using HTML ,CSS & JAVASCRIPT.
<br>
It is also User-Friendly as well as responsive for all of the screens.
<br>
The user enters a task in the input field.
<br>
By clicking the "Add" button, the task is added to the task list, where it can be viewed along with other tasks.
<br>
Each task has buttons to mark it as complete or delete it from the list.
<br>
Tasks are saved in local storage after adding , deleting and refreshing the page ,so that they are retained across sessions.
